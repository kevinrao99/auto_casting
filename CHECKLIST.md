Things to check on audition form:

- All Yes/No columns are indeed Yes/No, e.g. not YES/NO
- Dance cap number is entered in the sheet as an integer
- All appearances of dance names are character by character identical e.g. not "Daniel + Kevin" in one place and "Daniel & Kevin" in another
- Either we've required to specify top 3 dances or implemented dealing with missing selections



Things to check before running:

- Reading the correct columns from auditioners input sheet
- Audition numbers are cleaned to unique integers
- All dance names are being properly loaded with assign_dance_ids
- All choreo sheet names are properly updated in read_choreo_data
- Update max dance sizes
